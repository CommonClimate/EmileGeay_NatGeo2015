# EmileGeay_NatGeo2015
Code and data to reproduce the analysis of *Emile-Geay et al, 2015: Linkages between tropical Pacific seasonal, interannual, and orbital variability during the Holocene, Nature Geocience.
(full publications details to follow)*

Matlab code to reproduce the figures of the paper is provided in `code/matlab/``.
Running holocene_proxy_workflow at the Matlab prompt will generate .mat files from the original data files (.csv or .xls), run the block-bootstrap analysis, and produce figures. Note that the uncertainty quantification of Carr√© et al [2014] was carried out separately, and is stored in /data/obs/Quantiles_Carre_orig.mat and /data/obs/Quantiles_Carre_ratios.mat'.

The original data files for Holocene proxy observations are located in data/obs/.
a mat file containing the result of the block-bootstrap sampling of PMIP3 results is located in data/pmip3/.  

The relevant Python code is in code/python.
